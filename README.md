# Healthy Lifestyle Assistant

Healthy Lifestyle Assistant is a Ukrainian non-profit startup promoting health and wellbeing. Web application aims to support people to change their behavior and improve their health in order to live happier, longer lives.

A healthy lifestyle is a way of living that lowers the risk of being seriously ill or dying early. Not all diseases are preventable, but a large portion of deaths, particularly those from coronary heart disease and lung cancer, can be avoided. Scientific studies have identified certain types of behavior that contribute to the development of noncommunicable diseases and early death. Health is not just about avoiding disease. Itâ€™s also about physical, mental and social wellbeing. When a healthy lifestyle is adopted, a more positive model is provided for other people in the family, particularly children.
